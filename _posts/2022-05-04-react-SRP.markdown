When working in react, try to separate presentational from stateful/dynamic components.

Youâ€™ll find testing much easier if you find a way to split a component like Todo into something like Todo and TodoContainer.

The TodoContainer can deal with the state, any effects etc. Your unit tests just need to test that it passes props to a Todo correctly.

The Todo displays differently depending on the props you pass in.

Look at the imports for hints that you might benefit from splitting a component. If your component imports useState, useEffect AND a CSS file, or styled components or anything like that it is probably doing too much.

I often look at the imports to get a sense of the responsibility a file has, and too many different kinds of imports suggests too many responsibilities to me! Remember SRP!
